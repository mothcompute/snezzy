SNES emulator for awful people

## What?

you know how zsnes 0.150 is all kinds of awful? i want an emulator that is accurate enough to run most games, but is completely crippled in sound and video. i want to scream. i want to scream, and i want to be able to say it's my own damn fault

## What's wrong with you?

wish i knew

## How do I play games in it?

i ask myself this too!

short answer: thats the neat thing. you dont

long answer: build layla and create an instruction decode loop, write a memory remapper, and implement 96% of the opcodes in the 65816 emulator. next, create an emulator for the ricoh 5a22 extensions, the spc700, and the s-ppu. finally, send me your code because you just made an entire emulator! congratulations! you can play any game without expansion chips!
