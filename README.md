SNES emulator for awful people

## What?

you know how zsnes 0.150 is all kinds of awful? i want an emulator that is accurate enough to run most games, but is completely crippled in sound and video. i want to scream. i want to scream, and i want to be able to say it's my own damn fault

ultimately it will let you use proper emulation but it primarily serves to suck badly and will let you do stuff like mess with data and address lines or disable audio/video features or emulate old zsnes audio because it sounds lovely

## What's wrong with you?

wish i knew

## How do I play games in it?

wish i knew

## What's the name mean?
